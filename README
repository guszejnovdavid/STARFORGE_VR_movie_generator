This is a pipeline to generate movies with moving camera positions from STARFORGE simulations using CrunchSnaps. It can also create cubemaps and convert them to 360Â°/VR movies, see https://youtu.be/8nCW7419FyU for an example.

Requirements:
    -CrunchSnaps (https://github.com/mikegrudic/CrunchSnaps)
    -ffmpeg (https://ffmpeg.org/download.html, note that it is not trivial to install on TACC)

Steps:
1) The details of the camera trajectory are set in stellarscape_movie.py, edit it to set up the movie.
2) Edit setup_dirs.sh and add the required paths, email etc. at the top. Then run it, which will creates run folders.
3) Queue up each CrunchSnaps rendering run (./*/run_vis.sh), either by hand or by using submit_all.sh 
4) Queue up submit_make_movie.sh which will use ffmpeg to render movies for each direction.
5) If you want to also create a 360degree/VR movie go to ./360_movie_generator and follow the steps in the README there

Editing Blender files:
Each Blender file is set to render 4000 frames. In case you want to change them here is what you need to do:
1) Open in Blender, on the right find the "Output Properties" tab and set "Frame Range" (This sets the numbering of output and input files)
2) For *each* cubemap direction select the Collection in top right then choose the "Material Properties" tab. Under "Surface/Emission" you can set the filename format (by specify the name of the file from which you sticth the first frame) and set the numbering like in "Output Properties" (see existing files for how to exactly set the numbers)

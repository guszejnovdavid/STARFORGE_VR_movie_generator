This is a pipeline to generate movies with moving camera positions from STARFORGE simulations using CrunchSnaps. It can also create cubemaps and convert them to 360Â°/VR movies, see https://youtu.be/8nCW7419FyU for an example.

Requirements:
    -CrunchSnaps (https://github.com/mikegrudic/CrunchSnaps)
    -ffmpeg (https://ffmpeg.org/download.html, note that it is not trivial to install on TACC)

Steps:
1) The details of the camera trajectory are set in stellarscape_movie.py, edit it to set up the movie.
2) Edit setup_dirs.sh and add the required paths, email etc. at the top. Then run it, which will creates run folders.
3) Queue up each CrunchSnaps rendering run (./*/run_vis.sh), either by hand or by using submit_all.sh 
4) Queue up submit_make_movie.sh which will use ffmpeg to render movies for each direction.
5) If you want to also create a 360degree/VR movie go to ./360_movie_generator and follow the steps in the README there
